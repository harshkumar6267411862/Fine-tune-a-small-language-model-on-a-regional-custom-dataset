# 🚀 LLM Fine-Tuning for Hinglish Text Generation

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate Hinglish (Hindi + English mixed language) text.

The objective of this project is to build an end-to-end pipeline that:

- Collects and cleans Hinglish text data  
- Preprocesses and tokenizes the dataset  
- Fine-tunes a transformer-based language model  
- Evaluates model performance  
- Deploys an interactive web interface using Streamlit  

This project demonstrates the full lifecycle of training and deploying a custom language model.

## 🧠 What This Project Does

- Trains a causal language model on a Hinglish corpus  
- Saves the fine-tuned model locally  
- Loads the trained model for inference  
- Provides a Streamlit web app for real-time text generation  

Users can input Hinglish prompts and receive AI-generated responses instantly.
